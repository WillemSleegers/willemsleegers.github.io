I wrote my PhD dissertation in LaTeX, assuming it would be easier to use (in the long run!) compared to a standard text editor like Pages or Word. Pages does not support all of the functions needed for a beautiful dissertation (step up your game, Apple) and I dislike working in Word. Preferably, I would have written my dissertation in Markdown, but that also seems too limited for a dissertation. Hence, LaTeX. 

In the end, I'm not sure whether it was worth it. I had to figure out a lot of things, which took me many hours, and the end result was just a whole mixup of packages of which I barely understood what they do. I did not have any experience working in LaTeX so I also took this as an opportunity to figure out whether I like it. My conclusion: I do not. There does not seem to be any kind of vision behind the structure underlying LaTeX, as seen in the need for a package for almost every single feature you would like to see in a text document. Unfortunately, it's probably the only workable tool at the moment for a complex document like a dissertation.

Perhaps, then, having a suitable template might do the trick, so I present you with mine. You can find a PDF example of the template [here](/../../misc/dissertation_template.pdf).

It has the following features:

- Standard pages for a dissertation (e.g., supervisor/assessment committee page)
- Table of contents
- Two page structure with footers and headers (see example)
- Figures
- Bibliography support with in-text references that link to the reference in the References section AND with page numbers in the References section to link back to the page where the reference was found
