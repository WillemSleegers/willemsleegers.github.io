<p>One of the first issues I ran into when starting to analyze eye tracker data was that the raw data does not contain a trial-based time variable. I expected that the timestamp variable would be a variable that starts at 0 when a trial begins and that it would keep adding up at a rate equal to the sampling frequency, until the end of the trial. Instead, you are likely to get a timestamp variable that looks like a random set of numbers, as shown here:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 x 4
##    subject timestamp trial pupil
##      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1       1 212275472     1  3.73
##  2       1 212292222     1  3.74
##  3       1 212308845     1  3.74
##  4       1 212325470     1  3.76
##  5       1 212342094     1  3.75
##  6       1 212358844     2  3.76
##  7       1 212375469     2  3.77
##  8       1 212392094     2  3.76
##  9       1 212408718     2  3.77
## 10       1 212425344     2  3.76</code></pre>
<p>The <code>timestamp</code> variable actually reflects the internal clock of the hardware used to get the data. This means that each measurement recording has a specific clock time associated with it, rather than a time stamp related to an event in the experiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, itâ€™s relatively easy to turn this variable into a more useful variable. What we want is a variable, say <code>time</code>, that starts at 0 when a trial begins. The subsequent measures, in the same trial, should then be timed relative to the start of the trial. We want this for every trial.</p>
<p>The required steps to get this variable are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For each trial, get the minimum of the <code>timestamp</code> variable (e.g., 212275472 in trial 1)</li>
<li>Repeat this value across the entire trial</li>
<li>Subtract this value from the <code>timestamp</code> variable</li>
</ol>
<p>In R, this would look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
    group_by(subject, trial) %&gt;%
    mutate(time = timestamp - min(timestamp)) -&gt; data

data$time &lt;- data$time / 1000</code></pre>
<p>We take our data frame, group the data by <code>subject</code> and <code>trial</code> (because we want the minimum for each individual trial), and create a new variable called <code>time</code> that is equal to the value in <code>timestamp</code> minus the minimum of the timestamp for that trial. Additionally, we divide the result by a 1000 because the internal clock is in microseconds, and I prefer milliseconds. The result is this:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 x 5
## # Groups:   subject, trial [2]
##    subject timestamp trial pupil  time
##      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1       1 212275472     1  3.73   0. 
##  2       1 212292222     1  3.74  16.8
##  3       1 212308845     1  3.74  33.4
##  4       1 212325470     1  3.76  50.0
##  5       1 212342094     1  3.75  66.6
##  6       1 212358844     2  3.76   0. 
##  7       1 212375469     2  3.77  16.6
##  8       1 212392094     2  3.76  33.2
##  9       1 212408718     2  3.77  49.9
## 10       1 212425344     2  3.76  66.5</code></pre>
<p>We see that our new variable time indeed starts at 0, adds up until the next trial, where it starts at 0 again. Excellent!</p>
