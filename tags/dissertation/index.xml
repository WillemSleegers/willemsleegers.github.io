        <title>My LaTeX dissertation template</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote my PhD dissertation in LaTeX, assuming it would be easier to use (in the long run!) compared to a standard text editor like Pages or Word. Pages does not support all of the functions needed for a beautiful dissertation (step up your game, Apple) and I dislike working in Word. Preferably, I would have written my dissertation in Markdown, but that also seems too limited for a dissertation. Hence, LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether it was worth it. I had to figure out a lot of things, which took me many hours, and the end result was just a whole mixup of packages of which I barely understood what they do. I did not have any experience working in LaTeX so I also took this as an opportunity to figure out whether I like it. My conclusion: I do not. There does not seem to be any kind of vision behind the structure underlying LaTeX, as seen the need for a package for almost every single feature you would like to see in a text document. Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s probably the only workable tool at the moment for a complex document like a dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, then, having a suitable template might do the trick, so I present you with mine. You can find a PDF example of the template &lt;a href=&#34;https://willemsleegers.github.io/../../misc/dissertation_template.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard pages for a dissertation (e.g., supervisor/assessment committee page)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table of contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two page structure with footers and headers (see example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bibliography support with in-text references that link to the reference in the References section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the LaTeX template &lt;a href=&#34;https://willemsleegers.github.io/../../misc/dissertation_template.zip&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
