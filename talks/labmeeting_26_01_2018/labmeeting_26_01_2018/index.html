<p>Goal: To get feedback on my argumentation regarding my problem statement; and your initial impressions of a possible solution I have for it.</p>
<p>The presentation will consist of 2 two parts. First I will explain the problem, then I will discuss a potential solution. At the end of each part I would like to hear what you think. Before that, please only ask questions of clarification.</p>

<h2>Science 2.0</h2>
<p>In the last several years we have seen many improvements to how we do science. We now:</p>

<li>Hypothesis testing (duh)</li>
<li>Effect size estimation
<ul>
<li>e.g., practical application, power analyses</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assessing evidential value

<p>We see the Results section not just as a collection of statistics, but also a story, aimed at a reader with limited time and motivation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a conflict between being comprehensive (reporting everything) and providing a streamlined story</li>
</ul>
<p>And we do not have a good workflow solution that allows us to easily organize the output of statistical analyses and communicate this .</p>
<ul>
<li>Meaning we have to resort to scanning our output (whether it’s SPSS or R) and manually copy over statistical results into or out of a manuscript</li>

<p>I think these two observations are responsible for two problems in statistics reporting:</p>

<h2>Incorrect reporting</h2>
<p>Inaccuracies in statistics reporting are prevalent <span class="citation">(M. B. Nuijten et al., 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>In psychology, about <strong>half of all articles</strong> contain at least one inconsistent result in which the reported <em>p</em>-value does not correspond with the accompanying test statistic and degrees of freedom <span class="citation">(M.

</div>
<div id="incorrect-reporting-causes" class="section level2">
<h2>Incorrect reporting causes</h2>
<p>Probable reasons for these errors are <span class="citation">(Lakens, 2015)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typos</li>
<li>Copy-paste errors</li>
<li>Incorrect rounding</li>
<li>Incorrect use of ‘&lt;’ instead of ‘=’</li>

<p><code>statcheck</code> was created to detect inconsistencies in statistics reporting, and can also be used to correct mistakes.</p>
<p>Simply go to <a href="http://www.statcheck.io" class="uri">http://www.statcheck.io</a> and upload your manuscript. <code>statcheck</code> will then extract a portion of the statistics and check whether they are consistent.</p>
</div>
<div id="statcheck-limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>statcheck limitations</h2>
<p>However, statcheck cannot prevent all mistakes</p>
<ul>
<li>it cannot extract all statistics (e.g., from tables)
<ul>
<li>extracts about 61% of the statistics</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it is good (really good!), but not perfect</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“We stress that statcheck is an algorithm that will, like any automated procedure exposed to real-world data, sometimes lead to false positives or false negatives. These limitations should be taken into account, preferably by manually double-checking inconsistencies detected by statcheck.” <span class="citation">(M. Nuijten, Assen, Hartgerink, Epskamp, &amp; Wicherts, 2017)</span></p>

<div id="silliness" class="section level2">
<h2>Silliness</h2>
<p>I think it is silly to have to go through the effort of <em>text extraction</em> to get at the output of statistical analyses.</p>
<p>Whether it is to check for mistakes or for extracting the statistics needed for your research.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-better-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>What is a better solution?</h2>
<p>Add an extra step in the data analysis workflow:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Before</em> writing up the results, first organize the output of the statistical analyses in a separate text file
<ul>
<li>Storing statistics outside of the manuscript frees up the manuscript to be more streamlined</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Then <em>use</em> this text file to write up the results

<li>An organized output file can be used to automate statistics reporting</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Not all statistics are reported</li>

<p>I believe we should work on structuring the output of statistical analyses in such a manner that we can share <em>all</em> output, outside of our manuscript, and <em>use</em> it to more easily, and without error, write up the results in our manuscript.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div id="tidystats" class="section level2">
<h2>tidystats</h2>
<p><em>tidystats</em> is an R package to easily create a text file containing the output of statistical models.</p>

</div>
<div id="how-does-it-work" class="section level2">
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>The idea is that you start with an empty list, and whenever you conduct an analysis that you want to share the results of, you add it to the list.</p>
<p>At the end of data analysis, you take this list and simply save it as a text file.</p>
<p>This text file is a comma separated data file, which can be shared and read by anyone.</p>

<h2>Reporting statistics</h2>
<p>Because all statistics are structered in a known manner, it is very easy to write functions that return APA-styled output.</p>
<p>In some cases, this means you only need to provide the identifier in order to produce an APA line of output.</p>
<p>For example, <code>report(&quot;sleep_t_test&quot;)</code> results in: <em>t</em>(18) = -1.86, <em>p</em> = .079</p>
</div>
<div id="reporting-statistics-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Reporting statistics</h2>
<p>We can combine this with <a href="rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> to write a results section.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>We found a significant positive effect of drugs on hours of sleep, 
`report(&quot;sleep_t_test&quot;, results = results)`.</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found a significant positive effect of drugs on hours of sleep, <em>t</em>(18) = -1.86, <em>p</em> = .079.</p>

<p>I think we should have an explicit step in our data analysis workflow that is focused on the output of statistical analyses.</p>
<p>With the aim of sharing <strong>all</strong> statistical output.</p>
