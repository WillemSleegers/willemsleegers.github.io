      <description>TIBER 2017 talk At TIBER 2017 I gave a talk about oTree, an open-source platform for conducting web, field, and lab experiments. Below you can find a link to this talk, as well as something resembling a transcript of the talk (I like writing out what Iâ€™m going to say for a talk).
My talk was mostly a demonstration of oTree, so it contains links to oTree experiments. Unfortunately I cannot promise that these links will always remain active, so check it out while you can!</description>
