      <description>I am very excited to announce my first ever R package, called tidystats. Its function is to create a single text file containing the output of statistical models. This will enable researchers to store the results of their analyses not just in their manuscripts, but also in an organized file separate from their manuscript that they can freely share with anyone. In this blog post I will go into why I think it is useful to do this and how tidystats works conceptually.</description>
